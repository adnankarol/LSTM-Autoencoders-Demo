# LSTM Autoencoder

Welcome to the LSTM Autoencoder project! This repository provides examples of how to use LSTM Autoencoders for time series data reconstruction and anomaly detection.

## Overview

### What is an Autoencoder?

In simple terms, an Autoencoder is a type of neural network used to learn efficient representations of data. It works by taking an input sample, encoding it into a compressed form (called the latent variable), and then reconstructing the input from this compressed representation. This process helps in denoising and feature extraction.

For a detailed explanation of LSTM Autoencoders, check out this [Medium article](https://adnanmushtaq5.medium.com/lstm-autoencoder-9094615a019d).

## Applications

### Anomaly Detection

LSTM Autoencoders are particularly useful for anomaly detection in time series data. By training an autoencoder on normal (non-anomalous) data, it learns to reconstruct this data effectively. When presented with anomalous data, the reconstruction error will be significantly higher, allowing us to detect anomalies.

To understand more about using LSTM Autoencoders for anomaly detection, read my [Medium article on the subject](https://adnanmushtaq5.medium.com/lstm-autoencoder-for-anamoly-detection-a0d77bb1540e).

## Detailed Explanation

### Series Data Reconstruction with LSTM Autoencoders

Autoencoders work by compressing input data into a latent space representation and then reconstructing the input from this compressed form. This approach is useful for removing noise and capturing important features from the data.

### Applications of Autoencoders

Autoencoders can be used for various purposes:
- **Noise Removal**
- **Feature Extraction** (using only the encoder part)
- **Anomaly Detection**

This repository focuses on anomaly detection in time series data using LSTM Autoencoders. We train the autoencoder on normal data, allowing it to reconstruct inputs accurately. When faced with data containing anomalies, the reconstruction error will be higher, making it easier to identify anomalies.

For a continuation of previous discussions on data structuring, model architecture, and output analysis, refer to my earlier blog.

## How It Works

1. **Train the Autoencoder**: The model learns to reconstruct normal sequences.
2. **Evaluate Reconstruction Error**: Check Mean Squared Error (MSE) between reconstructed output and the original input.
3. **Detect Anomalies**: Evaluate the reconstruction error for sequences with anomalies. High error indicates the presence of anomalies.

By leveraging Autoencoders and reconstruction errors, this project demonstrates how to identify anomalies effectively.
